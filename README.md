# SharpBoot
SharpBoot is a program for creating multiboot ISOs or USB keys by choosing other ISO files and putting them in categories.
You can choose between Syslinux and Grub4DOS, you can choose filesystem (when making an USB key) between FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32, you can choose resolution between 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768.
You can also pick a custom background image (automatically resized to chosen resolution).
